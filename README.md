## 💻 ~Getting started~

As said earlier, this project is from an early stage of mine. I consider it legacy. Therefore, several concepts are applied in a flawed way, preventing sharing in an easier way for you. Sorry for the inconvenience :(

## ✨ Coming Soon

"Pets" marked my life for being my entry point in modeling projects, databases and a website. Therefore, this system will gain a new version, using current technologies and receiving new features.
